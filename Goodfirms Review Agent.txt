AI Agent for GoodFirms Reviews – Requirements
1. Objective
Build an AI agent that reviews, enhances, and prepares client reviews for the GoodFirms profile while preserving authenticity and complying with GoodFirms’ review and reputation guidelines.goodfirms+1
2. Scope
* In-scope:

   * Intake of raw client feedback from forms, emails, and CRM notes.

   * Automated quality, sentiment, and compliance checks.

   * Language and structure enhancement of reviews without altering facts.

   * Risk detection for fake, biased, or non-compliant reviews.

   * Recommendation workflow: AI suggestion → human approval/edit → final review text for GoodFirms.

      * Out-of-scope (current version):

         * Direct publishing to GoodFirms (manual posting assumed).

         * Non-text review assets (images, videos, large attachments).

3. Inputs & Data Model
            * Mandatory fields: reviewer name, role, company, project name/summary, engagement type, budget range, duration, technologies, rating (e.g., 1–5), free-text feedback.goodfirms+1

            * Optional fields: NPS/likelihood to recommend, industry, geography, project URL/portfolio link.[goodfirms]​

            * Internal metadata: review source (form/email/CRM), collection date, internal owner, GoodFirms status (draft/submitted/published).[goodfirms]​

4. Functional Requirements
               1. Ingestion & Validation

                  * Accept inputs via API and simple internal form.

                        * Perform sentiment analysis and topic extraction (communication, timeliness, quality, support, ROI).getstream+1

                        * Detect spam, templated content, self-written reviews by internal team, and duplicate/near-duplicate reviews.

                        * Score each review on completeness and clarity (e.g., 0–100).

                           3. Enhancement (Text Generation)

                              * Improve grammar, coherence, and narrative flow while preserving meaning and sentiment.

                              * Ensure GoodFirms-friendly structure: context (client & project), problem, solution, delivery, outcomes, recommendation.goodfirms+1

                              * Provide a side-by-side original vs enhanced version and a short explanation of key edits.

                                    * Check for: hate/abuse, threats, NSFW, slurs, personal data leakage (emails, phones, addresses), defamation, and legal risk terms.anolytics+2

                                    * Enforce platform-style rules: no fake testimonials, no unverifiable claims, no explicit competitor-bashing.[goodfirms]​

                                    * Classify each review into:

                                       * “Safe – Ready for approval”

                                       * “Borderline – needs human review”

                                       * “High risk – recommended reject”

                                          5. Authenticity & Risk Signals

                                             * Heuristics for suspicious reviews: identical language patterns, mismatched project details, extreme ratings with vague text, known bad domains/emails.opporture+1

                                                   * Allow internal user to: approve enhanced text, edit then approve, or reject with a reason.

                                                   * Log every decision and edit for audit and later tuning.
