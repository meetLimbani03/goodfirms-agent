We started using it to automate outbound calls and reduce manual workload, and it has genuinely helped us scale without hiring extra staff. The setup process was straightforward, and the dashboard is easy to understand even for non-technical users. Call quality has been consistent, and the AI handles basic lead qualification smoothly. We’ve noticed an improvement in response time and follow-up efficiency. While there’s still some room for more advanced customisation and deeper integrations, the platform delivers solid performance for its price point. Overall, it’s been a reliable and cost-effective solution for our outreach efforts.",

I started with the free plan just to test it, and honestly, I didn’t expect much - but I was surprised in a very positive way. Their support team is extremely fast. Every time I had a question or needed help, I received a quick and clear response. They don’t delay, and they genuinely focus on solving the issue properly. Even as a free user, I never felt ignored. That level of support really builds trust. The platform is also easy to understand, campaigns are simple to set up, and email performance has been stable and reliable. Overall, it feels practical, straightforward, and customer-focused.",

As an interior designer, realism, speed, and visual impact are extremely important to me and D5 Render truly delivers on all three. I use D5 Render alongside 3ds Max, and the workflow between the two feels smooth, modern, and very efficient. Earlier, when I was rendering with V Ray, the process was much more time consuming. Achieving realistic lighting, materials, and ambience required long render times, heavy system usage, and often additional Photoshop work to enhance realism. Even after all that effort, making quick changes or client revisions was stressful and slow. D5 Render has completely changed that experience.",

The real-time rendering system allows me to instantly adjust lighting, materials, and camera angles without waiting for multiple test renders.\nThe integration with SketchUp is smooth and efficient, which is essential for my architectural visualization projects. D5 helps me focus more on design decisions rather than technical rendering setup.\nOverall, it increased my productivity and helped me deliver projects to clients more quickly while maintaining high visual quality.",

Because anyone can start a chat, see what was said, and carry on without the customer repeating everything, it has also improved staff coordination.

We deal with a lot of repeat calls, quick questions, and urgent requests, and it’s easy for leads to slip when the phone is busy. With SalesCaptain, calls and texts stay in one place, so our team can see the full history and reply with context instead of starting over. The missed-call textback and follow-up automations help us recover jobs we would have lost—especially after hours or during peak service windows. It’s also made handoffs easier between dispatch and technicians because notes and conversation history are accessible. After some initial setup and template tuning, it’s been reliable day-to-day and has helped us book faster with less manual chasing.",

The setup process was smoother than I expected, and their team provided clear guidance during onboarding. What impressed me most was how natural the AI voice interactions sounded — customers didn’t feel like they were talking to a machine. Within a few weeks, we noticed fewer missed calls, faster response times, and better lead qualification before our sales team got involved. It also helped streamline our workflow since repetitive communication tasks were handled automatically. Overall, it’s been a practical solution that delivers measurable improvements in efficiency and customer engagement.",

We used to lose reservations as a result of missing calls or responding slowly. In order to prevent leads from going cold, we may respond to missed-call messages promptly with SalesCaptain and carry on conversations via SMS. Our team can easily continue where someone left off without having to ask the same questions because all of the calls, texts, and voicemails are in one location along with the complete client history. Additionally, we follow up more frequently, which has increased the number of inquiries that result in scheduled consultations and meetings. All in all, it has improved the speed, ease, and professionalism of our communication.",
