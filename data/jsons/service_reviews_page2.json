Their team understands the unique needs of nonprofits, especially when it comes to protecting data, ensuring donation functionality, and maintaining a trustworthy online presence.\nThey brought a thoughtful approach to improving our website’s performance and structure, particularly around key pages like donations and program information. Their recommendations helped create more clarity for both users and search engines, which is essential for long-term growth.\nWhat stood out most was their responsiveness and willingness to collaborate. They were open to feedback, patient in explaining technical details, and committed to helping us make informed decisions.\nLike any project of this nature, clarity around scope and timelines is important, and I would encourage future clients to align closely on expectations from the start.",

The project included several complex and customized requirements to properly support our customers and showcase our products, and the team at Zen handled everything with professionalism and expertise.\nFrom the beginning, Zen took the time to thoroughly review our previous websites to fully understand our goals and functionality needs. Throughout the entire process, the team was responsive, patient, and incredibly helpful, especially when answering my endless questions and concerns.\nIt has now been about a year since launch, and we continue to be pleased with both the performance of the site and our decision to partner with Zen Agency. I would confidently recommend them for any website project, large or small.",

This hasn't been a big issue since we haven't needed much additional work since we launched.
