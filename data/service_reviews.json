Their involvement provided an objective review of our application at a time when internal teams were focused heavily on feature delivery.\nRather than limiting testing to predefined cases, they explored system behavior across real-world scenarios and stressed key components to evaluate performance consistency. They identified logic inconsistencies and integration gaps that could have impacted user trust if released unnoticed. Their feedback was prioritized clearly, allowing our team to resolve issues efficiently without disrupting sprint cycles.\nOne of the most valuable aspects of working with Q-Pros was their ownership mindset. They tracked progress closely, validated fixes, and ensured nothing critical remained open before release. As a result, post-launch incidents were significantly reduced, and overall system performance was more predictable.",

The team of 6-10 experts showed a high level of ownership, ensuring all critical components—including the matching engine and wallet integrations—were delivered exactly on schedule.
