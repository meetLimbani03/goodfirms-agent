### New patterns not covered
- `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch4_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json` shows ten software reviews that all reached step 3 with solid content/ratings but were rejected as “Unable to verify the reviewer” because every record lacks a `client_profile_link` and nine of ten submit personal Gmail addresses. The current text never says how to handle submissions that pass completeness checks yet offer only a personal email and no verifiable profile, so we keep flipping between “no hard fail on Gmail” and “manual review” with no rule to codify the manual-review gate.
- The same batch reveals most reviewers set `hidden_identity` to `1` or `2` (name-only display), so they are already opting to hide company context while still missing LinkedIn/company-domain proof; the policy does not treat hidden-posting preferences as an additional signal when identity evidence is absent, yet humans are flagging these submissions purely for that lack of proof.

### Redundant rules to remove
- `docs/review-verification-steps.md:83-85` (the “Personal email domains are allowed… do not hard-fail solely for personal email” bullet) is redundant and conflicting with the new identity-evidence gate: the batch proves that Gmail-only reviewers are being stopped when no other proof exists, so keeping this tolerance statement encourages agents to ignore the very signal that has led to repeated “Unable to verify” rejections. Drop that bullet to align instructions with what actually triggers manual-review escalations.

### Exact proposed text edits
- Insert under **4.2 If no LinkedIn profile (Google login or unavailable)** (docs/review-verification-steps.md:79-86) between the softer-checks bullets and the (removed) personal-email tolerance: “If the reviewer submits no profile link and the only email/domain evidence is a personal mailbox (gmail/outlook/yahoo) or they have opted into hidden-identity modes (`hidden_identity` 1/2) without supplying a company domain or website, escalate to `needs_manual_review`, log the missing proof, and request a verifiable profile before granting `verified_pass`.” This explicitly codifies the pattern observed in the batch.
- After the new bullet, optionally add to **4.3 Suggested evidence tiers** (docs/review-verification-steps.md:87-90) a clarifying clause: “Low evidence (no profile + only a personal email/hidden identity preference) should automatically map to `needs_manual_review` instead of allowing any auto-approve outcome.”
