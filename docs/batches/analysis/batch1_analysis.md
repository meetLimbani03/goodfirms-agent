New patterns not covered
- Entirely blank reviews (title/summary/strength/weakness all empty) are showing up as “Review incomplete” even though they slip through upstream checks, e.g., the Mailcheck and aasaan app records still reach step 1 with zero-length text fields before being rejected. `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:325` `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:401`
- Several submissions include only filler tokens (single punctuation in strength/weakness, long repeated “ssss…” strings, or “Test Test…” loops) while the policy only calls out “random tokens” in a very general way; these placeholders should be caught earlier so we don’t keep flagging the same noise entries. `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:83` `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:261` `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:582`
- Legitimate prose can still fail verification because every identity field (LinkedIn, company name/website) is missing and only a personal email remains, as in the Pappyjoe submission; the current checks don’t say how much identity metadata must exist before we can approve, so we keep sliding into “Unable to verify” for reviews that otherwise pass the content gate. `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:521`

Redundant rules to remove
- Section 4.3’s “Suggested evidence tiers” merely restates the LinkedIn vs. personal-email logic already spelled out in 4.1/4.2, and every reject in the batch stays at the generic “Unable to verify” or “Review incomplete” level without ever using those tiers, so the list adds no new guidance and can be dropped to keep the policy lean. `docs/review-verification-steps.md:71` `docs/review-verification-steps.md:79` `docs/review-verification-steps.md:87` `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:259` `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:520` `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:579`

Exact proposed text edits
- After the existing readability bullets in section 1.1, insert: “Require at least one non-empty sentence in each of `title`, `summary`, and at least one of `strength`/`weakness`; any review where all four fields are blank or whitespace should be labeled ‘Review incomplete’ and prevented from entering the downstream verification pipeline.” (This addresses entries with entirely empty text fields.) `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:325` `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:401`
- Still within 1.1, add: “Treat single-character placeholders or long runs of repeated tokens (e.g., `,`, `.`, `ssss…`, `Test Test…`) in summary/strength/weakness as filler; flag such submissions for rewrite rather than letting them proceed to later stages.” `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:83` `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:261` `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch1_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:582`
- Remove section 4.3 (“Suggested evidence tiers,” line 87) entirely so the policy sticks to the actionable LinkedIn/personal-email checks already described in 4.1 and 4.2. `docs/review-verification-steps.md:87`
