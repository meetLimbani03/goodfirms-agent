- Add a rule catching reviews that simply repost previously published content; the existing “duplicate” check only targets quick repeats by the same reviewer, so replays from older batches slip through. Evidence: record `65dc4df13bd170e8fb04df55` is flagged “Review has already been published before.” Patch: `+ - reject submissions whose text exactly matches a previously published review for the same software, even if it arrives outside the short duplicate window or from another reviewer.`
