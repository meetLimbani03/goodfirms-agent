# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Planning detailed data analysis**

I need to dig deeper into the dataset by examining multiple entries and extracting relevant fields like title, response, summary, and others to uncover any missing patterns or issues. I want to check for things like empty summaries, odd ratings, or sedation mentions by reviewing around 10 entries to get a clearer picture. I'll try using jq commands to print out structured views of each entry so I can identify patterns to improve the rules.

**Identifying verification gaps in dataset**

I'm analyzing entries not covered by current review verification rules, focusing on patterns like empty reviews with hidden identities, unverifiable reviewers despite provided company info, and common reasons for rejection such as lack of LinkedIn or confirming client status; I want to propose precise new rules that target these gaps while avoiding redundancy.

**Analyzing data inconsistencies and verification issues**

I'm exploring weird data patterns, like why some `hidden_identity` values are strings while others are numbers. I want to see if mismatches between emails and company info, missing company websites, or lack of profiles might explain some "Unable to verify" flags despite softer checks for personal emails. I'll also run some Python analysis to count presence of key fields like profile links and company websites to spot any new patterns.

**Identifying new data verification patterns**

I’m analyzing the dataset against existing instructions to pinpoint new patterns like hidden identities combined with no verifiable profiles that cause verification failures, and entries missing required fields in early review steps. I’m also looking for potentially redundant rules that don’t align with the data and planning precise text edits to propose for the documentation.
