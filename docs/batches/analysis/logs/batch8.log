# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Examining JSON for new and redundant policy patterns**

I'll analyze the entire JSON dataset to identify recurring patterns not addressed by the current review-verification steps, such as hidden identity flags, incomplete fields, or unusual rating-summary mismatches. My goal is to pinpoint new patterns that merit policy additions, spot redundant rules that may be unnecessary given the data, and propose precise text edits referencing data examples to improve the policy accuracy. I'll likely parse the file with Python to systematically assess these trends and support my recommendations.

strength The task management is amazing. You can see what each employee is doing, what is the status of defifnite task, and the workload of each employee also can be seen!
weakness The one bad thing is that notifications about changings on my desk are coming late to me. But it's not really big problem, because most of managers changing cards and tasks at night, when time isn't important thing.

**Summarizing new policy insights and edits**

I've gathered several new patterns to propose: handling hidden identity reviewers without profile links, incomplete submissions slipping past pre-checks, and recognizing aggregator websites like Upwork as low evidence for verification. I also see that the duplicate-submission check rule seems redundant given no duplicates appear in the dataset. Now I'm crafting concise markdown sections outlining these new patterns, redundant rules to remove, and precise text edits to incorporate these findings into the policy.
thinking
**Preparing structured final message outline**

I'm organizing the final message with three exact sections named as requested: New patterns not covered, Redundant rules to remove, and Exact proposed text edits. Each bullet will reference dataset entries (by file and example IDs) supporting the points. I'll specify precise text insertions and removals for the policy, carefully naming sections to edit and including example sentences to add or delete. This will give a clear, concise, and actionable policy update plan.
codex
**New patterns not covered**
- Hidden-identity submissions dominate this batch (all 10 entries have `hidden_identity` set to `1` or `2`, and none provide a `client_profile_link`), so the agent often cannot triangulate a reviewer even when the written content looks plausible; the current policy never mentions how to treat “hide my details” requests beyond the generic verification flow.  
- Two records (`_id` `64f16b5c8487017dac0afd87` and `_id` `64f808fbffdfab339002f2e2`) were stuck at step 1 with blank ratings/body yet still hit the verifier, which proves the upstream completeness guard is leaky—verifying these partial submissions wastes effort and either needs a forced “return for completion” path or a clear “manual review” outcome.  
- At least one reviewer (`_id` `64e6d3609a9a61e50002137a`, Trello reviewer) listed only a marketplace/aggregator URL (`https://www.upwork.com/hire/us/`), which offers no direct company context and should not qualify as medium/high evidence; the policy currently treats any provided website as positive evidence without discriminating aggregator domains.

**Redundant rules to remove**
- Drop the placeholder bullet “1.5 Duplicate-submission check (this is hard…)”: none of the ten rejects in this batch are near-duplicates, and the current wording signals an unfinished idea rather than an actionable check, so it unnecessarily bloats the policy.

**Exact proposed text edits**
- Under **1) Common Checks** (after “1.4 Minimal rewrite scope”), insert: “*Step-completion guard* – confirm that the reviewer reached the final submission step with non-zero ratings/title/body before running verification. Blank/missing fields (step 1/2 records like `_id` `64f16b5c8487017dac0afd87`) should immediately route back to the form or land in `needs_manual_review`, because no amount of web checking can rescue an incomplete payload.”  
- In **4.2 If no LinkedIn profile…**, add: “When `hidden_identity` is flagged (e.g., this batch’s entries all lack profile links), require an alternate verifiable signal such as a company-provided email, published employee page, or a secondary contact; otherwise treat the review as `needs_manual_review` with a logged ‘identity withheld’ note instead of guessing.”  
- In **5) Web Fact-Check Rules**, append: “If the supplied company website resolves to a marketplace/aggregator (Upwork, general freelance platforms, etc., as in `_id` `64e6d3609a9a61e50002137a`), downgrade the evidence tier to `low` and document why it cannot anchor the reviewer; only direct company/brand pages should count as medium or high evidence.”  
- Remove the entire “1.5 Duplicate-submission check…” paragraph from Section 1.

**New patterns not covered**
- Hidden-identity submissions dominate this batch (all 10 entries have `hidden_identity` set to `1` or `2`, and none provide a `client_profile_link`), so the agent often cannot triangulate a reviewer even when the written content looks plausible; the current policy never mentions how to treat “hide my details” requests beyond the generic verification flow.  
- Two records (`_id` `64f16b5c8487017dac0afd87` and `_id` `64f808fbffdfab339002f2e2`) were stuck at step 1 with blank ratings/body yet still hit the verifier, which proves the upstream completeness guard is leaky—verifying these partial submissions wastes effort and either needs a forced “return for completion” path or a clear “manual review” outcome.  
- At least one reviewer (`_id` `64e6d3609a9a61e50002137a`, Trello reviewer) listed only a marketplace/aggregator URL (`https://www.upwork.com/hire/us/`), which offers no direct company context and should not qualify as medium/high evidence; the policy currently treats any provided website as positive evidence without discriminating aggregator domains.

**Redundant rules to remove**
- Drop the placeholder bullet “1.5 Duplicate-submission check (this is hard…)”: none of the ten rejects in this batch are near-duplicates, and the current wording signals an unfinished idea rather than an actionable check, so it unnecessarily bloats the policy.

**Exact proposed text edits**
- Under **1) Common Checks** (after “1.4 Minimal rewrite scope”), insert: “*Step-completion guard* – confirm that the reviewer reached the final submission step with non-zero ratings/title/body before running verification. Blank/missing fields (step 1/2 records like `_id` `64f16b5c8487017dac0afd87`) should immediately route back to the form or land in `needs_manual_review`, because no amount of web checking can rescue an incomplete payload.”  
- In **4.2 If no LinkedIn profile…**, add: “When `hidden_identity` is flagged (e.g., this batch’s entries all lack profile links), require an alternate verifiable signal such as a company-provided email, published employee page, or a secondary contact; otherwise treat the review as `needs_manual_review` with a logged ‘identity withheld’ note instead of guessing.”  
- In **5) Web Fact-Check Rules**, append: “If the supplied company website resolves to a marketplace/aggregator (Upwork, general freelance platforms, etc., as in `_id` `64e6d3609a9a61e50002137a`), downgrade the evidence tier to `low` and document why it cannot anchor the reviewer; only direct company/brand pages should count as medium or high evidence.”  
- Remove the entire “1.5 Duplicate-submission check…” paragraph from Section 1.
