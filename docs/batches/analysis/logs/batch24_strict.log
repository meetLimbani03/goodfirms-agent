Task: Analyze exactly one batch file against docs/review-verification-steps.md.

Output constraints (strict):
1) Return ONLY truly new rule deltas not already covered semantically by existing rules.
2) Do NOT restate, reword, or expand existing rules.
3) If no new delta exists, output exactly: NO_CHANGES.
4) Each proposed delta must include:
   - why existing rules do not already cover it
   - one concrete evidence record id from the batch
   - minimal patch text (add/remove/edit) in 1-3 lines
5) Prefer deletions when two sections overlap.
6) Keep total output under 180 tokens.

Decision standard:
- "New" means a distinct failure mode or decision branch not currently represented.
- If a rule is implied by current wording, treat it as covered and do not propose it.

# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Drafting new verification rule delta**
codex
Delta: Add hidden_identity handling because the verification steps never mention that UI flag even though hidden_identity=2 entries (e.g., 666ff22231491b18d374d8c2) were rejected for “Unable to verify the reviewer”, so that trace-loss signal is not covered; Evidence: 666ff22231491b18d374d8c2; Patch:
+# 4.4 Hidden-identity signals
+- When `hidden_identity` >1, require LinkedIn/company proof before `verified_pass`, otherwise escalate to `needs_manual_review`.
