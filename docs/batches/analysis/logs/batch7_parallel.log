# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

     1	# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)
     2	
     3	## Goal
     4	Define what the agent should verify for:
     5	- Software reviews
     6	- Service reviews
     7	- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
     8	- Web fact-check behavior
     9	
    10	This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
    11	Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.
    12	
    13	Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
    14	- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
    15	- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

    17	## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)
    18	
    19	### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
    20	- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

## New patterns not covered
- Repeated blank/zero-score submissions (two entries from `MUFEEDA KP` at `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch7_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:7` and `:8`) escape the “gibberish/placeholder” rule because no text exists at all—just a form with every narrative field and rating set to empty/0. We need a concrete guard against abandoned placeholder submissions that still clear the upstream completeness gate.
- The `Saviom` review (`docs/batches/software_rejected_batch7_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:6`) is marked “Reviews are accepted only from clients”, yet the submitter lists the vendor itself (same company name, marketing title, vendor website/email). There is no explicit rule banning vendor-employee testimonials, so these sneaky self‑endorsements keep slipping through.

## Redundant rules to remove
- The toggle “If title mismatches summary … rewrite title, do not reject” at `docs/review-verification-steps.md:121` simply restates the guidance already established in section 1.2 (`docs/review-verification-steps.md:27-31`). Removing the duplicate keeps the toggle list focused on real decision points.

## Exact proposed text edits
- `docs/review-verification-steps.md:25` — add a bullet after “Reject/flag if text is mostly random tokens…”:  
  “- Reject submissions where title/body/strength/weakness are all empty and every rating is 0, because these blank/zero-score forms (e.g., the two identical Desklog records) are abandoned placeholders rather than reviews.”
- `docs/review-verification-steps.md:58` — append to the software-specific checks right after “Client-relationship plausibility…”:  
  “- Reject or escalate when the reviewer’s company name/email/domain matches the software vendor (or the stated role is marketing/operations inside the vendor), since these are vendor self-reviews and not third-party clients.”
