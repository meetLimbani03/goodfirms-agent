Task: Analyze exactly one batch file against docs/review-verification-steps.md.

Output constraints (strict):
1) Return ONLY truly new rule deltas not already covered semantically by existing rules.
2) Do NOT restate, reword, or expand existing rules.
3) If no new delta exists, output exactly: NO_CHANGES.
4) Each proposed delta must include:
   - why existing rules do not already cover it
   - one concrete evidence record id from the batch
   - minimal patch text (add/remove/edit) in 1-3 lines
5) Prefer deletions when two sections overlap.
6) Keep total output under 180 tokens.

Decision standard:
- "New" means a distinct failure mode or decision branch not currently represented.
- If a rule is implied by current wording, treat it as covered and do not propose it.

# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Identifying gaps in review verification rules**

I'll analyze batch entries showing failures like "Unable to verify reviewer" and "incomplete review" that seem not fully covered by existing rules, proposing concise new deltas—such as enforcing non-empty textual fields in reviews—to address these uncovered scenarios.
thinking
**Proposing explicit check for empty reviews**
codex
- Add a “Review presence” check so submissions whose title/summary/strength/weakness are all blank are rejected as “incomplete review”; 1.1 currently only verifies readability if text exists, so empty batches like record `65b105dad45e4d758608a1a9` bypass the policy. Patch:
+### 1.1a Review presence
+- Reject reviews whose title/summary/strength/weakness are all empty (mark “incomplete review”).
