Task: Analyze exactly one batch file against docs/review-verification-steps.md.

Output constraints (strict):
1) Return ONLY truly new rule deltas not already covered semantically by existing rules.
2) Do NOT restate, reword, or expand existing rules.
3) If no new delta exists, output exactly: NO_CHANGES.
4) Each proposed delta must include:
   - why existing rules do not already cover it
   - one concrete evidence record id from the batch
   - minimal patch text (add/remove/edit) in 1-3 lines
5) Prefer deletions when two sections overlap.
6) Keep total output under 180 tokens.

Decision standard:
- "New" means a distinct failure mode or decision branch not currently represented.
- If a rule is implied by current wording, treat it as covered and do not propose it.

# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Proposing new review rules**

I’m identifying two new rules missing from the docs: one to reject reviews not in English, since readability rules don’t enforce language (evidence `65a7e8824e66b7f2de03b826`), and another to reject reviews from former employees, which is stronger than existing “vendor self-review” checks (evidence `65a6eb8c626bab7d2100ee8e`). I’ll propose minimal one-line patch additions referencing `docs/review-verification-steps.md` to add these explicit requirements.
thinking
**Summarizing new rule proposals**

I’m proposing two concise rule deltas: one adding an English-only review requirement since readability checks don’t specify language and record 65a7e8824e66b7f2de03b826 shows Spanish was rejected; another banning reviews from current or former employees as record 65a6eb8c626bab7d2100ee8e demonstrates that reason isn’t covered by existing vendor self-review warnings. Both include minimal patch lines for docs/review-verification-steps.md referencing the new explicit checks.
codex
Delta1: Common checks mention readability but not language, so no rule captures non-English rejects; record 65a7e8824e66b7f2de03b826 was flagged for Spanish wording. Evidence=65a7e8824e66b7f2de03b826
Patch:
docs/review-verification-steps.md
+ - Reject reviews submitted in languages other than English unless a verified translation exists.

Delta2: Reviewer logic warns about vendor self-reviews but never bans former employees, yet 65a6eb8c626bab7d2100ee8e was dropped for exactly that; we need an explicit prohibition. Evidence=65a6eb8c626bab7d2100ee8e
Patch:
docs/review-verification-steps.md
+ - Reject submissions from current or former employees of the reviewed vendor to avoid insider bias.
