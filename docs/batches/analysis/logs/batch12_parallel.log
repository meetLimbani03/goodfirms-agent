# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Summarizing verification step analysis**

I'm examining the JSON data to identify new review verification patterns missing from the policy, such as detecting self-reviews where reviewer company matches the vendor, and incomplete zero-rated placeholder reviews. I’m also considering redundant rules to remove and drafting precise text edits referencing file paths and line numbers to improve policy clarity and coverage.
thinking
**Organizing final markdown output**

I'm preparing the final markdown with exact sections—New patterns not covered, Redundant rules to remove, Exact proposed text edits—each with clearly referenced bullet points and detailed text modifications to insert or remove in the verification steps document, including example IDs and line references.

## New patterns not covered
- **Vendor self-review signal** – Batch entries `654a79109bb61c739a0f8d83`, `654a867232223aac8a034b24`, `654a98b4f7d3c9c0360a2bf2` all list `client_company_name: Success.ai` while reviewing Success.ai and were rejected with the note “Reviews are accepted only from clients of the company.” The policy currently only says “client-relationship plausibility” without explicitly catching cases where the reviewer’s stated employer is the same company (a classic self-review). We need a concrete rule that downgrades authenticity when `client_company_name` or email/domain matches the reviewed vendor.
- **Empty/zero placeholder submissions** – Entries `6538d55a339db2f305011154` and `653ffb283fe4dfd19b0ce6e8` show blank titles/summary/strength/weakness and zero scores for every rating, yet they reached the verification layer. The existing “upstream completeness” assumption was violated, so add a hard check for records that contain no narrative and all ratings at 0/empty; those should be rejected as incomplete placeholders before any new analysis.

## Redundant rules to remove
- Drop the Section 7 toggle “Should LinkedIn mismatch be hard reject or manual review? Recommended: manual review.” Section 4.1 already instructs that strong mismatches should become an authenticity flag/manual review, so the toggle merely rephrases that guidance without adding clarity.
- Remove the Section 7 toggle “Should personal email with no company-domain match be penalized strongly? Recommended: no hard penalty; treat as weak evidence only.” Section 4.2 already says personal email domains are allowed and should not trigger hard failure, making the toggle redundant.

## Exact proposed text edits
1. **Insert under “## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)” (after 1.5)**:
   ```
   ### 1.6 Placeholder/incomplete submissions
   - If `title`, `summary`, `strength`, and `weakness` are all empty/whitespace and every rating field (`ease_of_use`, `features_functionality`, `customer_support`, `overall`) is 0 or absent, treat the review as an incomplete placeholder.
   - Reject (`reject_recommended`) and log it immediately; these submissions bring no usable content even if other completeness checks erroneously forwarded them.
   ```
2. **Insert under “## 4) Reviewer Verification Logic” (after 4.3)**:
   ```
   ### 4.4 Vendor self-review detection
   - If the reviewer’s claimed company/email domain matches the software/service being reviewed (e.g., the Success.ai batch entries that listed Success.ai as the client company), downgrade the evidence tier and flag authenticity risk.
   - Reviews that read like promotional marketing while the reviewer identifies as the vendor should land in `needs_manual_review` or `reject_recommended`, because the claim set can’t be trusted without independent client confirmation.
   ```
3. **Remove from “## 7) Decision Toggles To Confirm”**:
   - The bullet “Should LinkedIn mismatch be hard reject or manual review? Recommended: manual review.”
   - The bullet “Should personal email with no company-domain match be penalized strongly? Recommended: no hard penalty; treat as weak evidence only.”
