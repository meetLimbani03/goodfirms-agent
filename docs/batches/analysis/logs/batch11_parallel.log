# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Analyzing verification patterns in dataset**

I'm planning to analyze the entire file to identify new verification patterns that haven't been covered, spot redundant rules, and suggest exact text edits. I'll focus on unique rejection reasons like repeated review publications or inability to verify reviewers by parsing the dataset for distinct reason fields using a Python script. This should help clarify what patterns to add or remove.

**Analyzing dataset for uncovered verification patterns**

I’m examining dataset entries that show verification failures despite details like LinkedIn profiles, aiming to identify new patterns not covered by existing rules. I’m noting issues like incomplete multi-step reviews, hidden identity flags, use of company rather than personal LinkedIn pages, repeated submissions, and possible misalignments in duplicate detection to propose fresh verification guidelines aligned with actual data.
thinking
**Identifying verification issues with titles and fields**

I’m exploring unusual dataset patterns like numeric-only titles, weak or nonsubstantive strength/weakness fields, and incomplete step statuses causing verification flags. I’m considering proposing new validation rules for these cases based on their absence or ambiguity in the current documentation.
