Task: Analyze exactly one batch file against docs/review-verification-steps.md.

Output constraints (strict):
1) Return ONLY truly new rule deltas not already covered semantically by existing rules.
2) Do NOT restate, reword, or expand existing rules.
3) If no new delta exists, output exactly: NO_CHANGES.
4) Each proposed delta must include:
   - why existing rules do not already cover it
   - one concrete evidence record id from the batch
   - minimal patch text (add/remove/edit) in 1-3 lines
5) Prefer deletions when two sections overlap.
6) Keep total output under 180 tokens.

Decision standard:
- "New" means a distinct failure mode or decision branch not currently represented.
- If a rule is implied by current wording, treat it as covered and do not propose it.

# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Identifying new duplicate review rule**

I found a new duplicate review scenario not covered by existing rules: reposts of reviews already published elsewhere outside the short time window and same-reviewer constraint. Evidence record id 655754be7f24305ebc08d693 shows a rejection for such a case. The patch adds a rule rejecting reviews matching previously published GoodFirms content, even without near-simultaneous resubmission.  
+ - Reject reviews whose text matches a previously published GoodFirms entry even when there is no rapid resubmission window to prevent reposted duplicates.
codex
- Delta: Current duplicate check only calls out near-simultaneous repeats from the same reviewer, but record 655754be7f24305ebc08d693 was rejected because the review had already been published previously; we need an explicit rule rejecting reposted copies even when no quick retry occurs. Evidence record id 655754be7f24305ebc08d693.  
  + - Reject reviews whose text matches a previously published GoodFirms entry even outside the short-window duplicate scenario to prevent reposted duplicates.
