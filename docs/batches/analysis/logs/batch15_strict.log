Task: Analyze exactly one batch file against docs/review-verification-steps.md.

Output constraints (strict):
1) Return ONLY truly new rule deltas not already covered semantically by existing rules.
2) Do NOT restate, reword, or expand existing rules.
3) If no new delta exists, output exactly: NO_CHANGES.
4) Each proposed delta must include:
   - why existing rules do not already cover it
   - one concrete evidence record id from the batch
   - minimal patch text (add/remove/edit) in 1-3 lines
5) Prefer deletions when two sections overlap.
6) Keep total output under 180 tokens.

Decision standard:
- "New" means a distinct failure mode or decision branch not currently represented.
- If a rule is implied by current wording, treat it as covered and do not propose it.

# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Identifying new failure modes**

I'm comparing batch entries against existing doc rules to find unique failure modes not yet covered, focusing on novelty to propose new rule deltas only if genuinely distinct from existing policies. I’m carefully analyzing each record’s reason and content to detect gaps, such as copy-pasted disclaimers or verification issues, while making sure I understand current rule coverage thoroughly.

**Identifying potential new verification rule**

I'm examining the batch and docs closely for any unique failure modes not already covered by existing rules. After thorough analysis, I think the main candidate is a new rule requiring narrative content (title, summary, strengths, weaknesses) even if ratings exist, since current rules mostly address text quality when present but not complete absence. The example record 6568862919a69d1bcb037008 supports this gap. I'll consider drafting a minimal patch adding a "Required narrative" bullet under common checks to address this scenario. Otherwise, no other distinct failure modes stand out.
thinking
**Proposing narrative content rule**

I'm drafting a concise delta to add a rule requiring minimal narrative text in reviews, since completely blank submissions bypass existing readability checks. The patch adds a brief new item under common checks highlighting this gap, referencing record 6568862919a69d1bcb037008 as evidence.
