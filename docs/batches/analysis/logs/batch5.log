# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence

title: Trello can help a travel agency
summary: We [IGoMorocco](https://www.igomorocco.com/) use Trello for managing our team projects, it is simple and easy to use.  very easy to get started with. 
Trello is a great project management tool for tour companies. It helped us to plan and organize our tours from start to finish. You can create boards for each desert tour, and then use lists and cards to track different aspects of the tour, such as logistics, marketing, and sales.
 It can help to streamline the planning and execution of trips .Trello can be used to plan trips by creating boards for each trip. These boards can be divided into lists for different aspects of the trip, such as flights, accommodations, activities, and transportation. Cards can then be created for each task or subtask, and these cards can be assigned to team members. This helps to keep track of all of the tasks that need to be completed for each trip, and it also helps to ensure that everyone on the team is aware of their responsibilities.

### New patterns not covered
- `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch5_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json` contains submissions (e.g., the Medicai Cloud PACS entry) with blank title/body/strength/weakness and zero scores but still routed for verification; the current “readability” guidance never explicitly rejects an empty payload, so we keep chasing these ghosts.
- The WebCEO entry in the same batch carries the human reason “Reviews are accepted only from clients of the company,” yet no rule currently enforces additional proof when a vendor explicitly limits reviews to verified customers; we need a policy hook that triggers manual-review/reject when the claimed policy cannot be satisfied with real evidence.

### Redundant rules to remove
- Section 5 (“Web Fact-Check Rules,” lines 92‑105) restates the same identity-verification checks already spelled out in sections 4.1‑4.2 and adds no new operational detail; keeping it simply duplicates guidance and makes the policy harder to navigate, so drop the whole section.

### Exact proposed text edits
1. `docs/review-verification-steps.md`: after line 25 (the placeholder content bullet under 1.1) add `- Reject/flag submissions where title/body/strength/weakness fields are empty or only whitespace/placeholder text, since they provide no actionable review content.`  
2. `docs/review-verification-steps.md`: after line 86 (end of the “personal email” note in 4.2) add `- When the vendor metadata or review text explicitly states that only verified clients may post reviews, require independent proof of that engagement (matching company email/domain, contract ref, case-study link, etc.); absence of proof becomes a manual-review/reject signal and should be logged as such.`  
3. `docs/review-verification-steps.md`: delete lines 92‑105 (the entire Section 5 “Web Fact-Check Rules”) to avoid duplicating the identity-verification guidance already captured in Section 4.
