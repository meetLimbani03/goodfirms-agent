# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Summarizing new and redundant verification patterns**
thinking
**Identifying missing and overlapping verification rules**

I'll outline new suspicious review patterns not covered in the document—like incomplete step-1 submissions with empty ratings/text, the unexplained hidden_identity flag requiring scrutiny, and placeholder metadata (e.g., company_name set to "None" despite a website present). I'll also flag the Decision Toggles section as redundant since it repeats earlier rules, and provide precise text additions and removals to update the verification steps accordingly.
thinking
**Proposing specific text additions and removals**

I'll suggest concrete text additions to add completeness gating for partial submissions, detect placeholder metadata in identity fields, and clarify use of the hidden_identity flag—all with precise wording to add after existing doc sections. I’ll also recommend removing the entire Section 7 to eliminate redundant toggles that restate earlier rules. This keeps the verification steps clear and more focused.
codex
## New patterns not covered
- The rejected batch includes entries that never leave the wizard (e.g., two Desklog records that stayed at `step`=1, all ratings zero, and blank narrative fields yet submitted twice within seconds). The policy currently only talks about readability; we need a completeness gate that blocks “empty” submissions before any textual verification.
- Some reviews set identity/company metadata to literal placeholders (`client_company_name` or `position` = “None”/“none”/“Dummy Content”) while still providing a real website/email. The policy does not call out those placeholder strings even though they mimic genuine data and should trigger extra scrutiny.
- Every record carries a `hidden_identity` flag (values 1–3 in this batch); the document never mentions how to treat that signal. Higher values correlate with manual-review reasons such as “Unable to verify the reviewer,” so the policy should clarify how the flag feeds authenticity scoring rather than ignoring it.

## Redundant rules to remove
- The entire “Decision Toggles To Confirm” section duplicates decisions already captured elsewhere (LinkedIn mismatch handling in §4.1, personal-email guidance in §4.2, title rewrite guidance in §1.2, and evidence thresholds implicit in §4.3). Removing Section 7 keeps the policy lean without losing any substantive guidance.

## Exact proposed text edits
1. **After §1.5 (Duplicate submissions)**, insert:
   ```
   ### 1.6 Submission completeness gating
   - Require that the review flow reaches the final step (step metadata ≥ final stage) and that at least one narrative field (summary/strength/weakness) plus the overall rating are populated before applying other checks. Early-stage submissions with `step`=1/2, zero ratings, and empty text (the Desklog rows in the rejected batch) should be flagged as incomplete/spam and not auto-approved.
   - When identical email/software combos resubmit with the same blank fields multiple times in quick succession, treat them as automation attempts and route to manual review instead of re-running the usual content checks.
   ```
2. **Within §1.1 (Content readability and coherence)**, add to the bullet list:
   ```
   - Flag identity/company metadata that contains literal placeholders (“None,” “none,” “Dummy Content,” “N/A,” emoji-only text, etc.) even if the narrative looks normal, especially when the same record still lists a real website or email; corroborating details must be corrected before verification can pass.
   ```
3. **After §4.3 (Suggested evidence tiers)**, append:
   ```
   ### 4.4 Hidden-identity signals
   - Respect the `hidden_identity` indicator provided with each review. Values above 1 mean the reviewer deliberately obscures their trace; do not relax identity verification in those cases. Require at least one external profile (LinkedIn/company site) before issuing a verified_pass, otherwise escalate to manual review.
   - Use the flag as part of the evidence tiering: a hidden_identity ≥3 with no verifiable link explains “Unable to verify the reviewer” outcomes in the batch and should never be auto-approved without medium/high evidence.
   ```
4. **Delete Section 7 (“Decision Toggles To Confirm”) entirely**, since its guidance is already embedded elsewhere (LinkedIn mismatch → §4.1, personal email tolerance → §4.2, title rewrite → §1.2, evidence minimum → §4.3).
