Task: Analyze exactly one batch file against docs/review-verification-steps.md.

Output constraints (strict):
1) Return ONLY truly new rule deltas not already covered semantically by existing rules.
2) Do NOT restate, reword, or expand existing rules.
3) If no new delta exists, output exactly: NO_CHANGES.
4) Each proposed delta must include:
   - why existing rules do not already cover it
   - one concrete evidence record id from the batch
   - minimal patch text (add/remove/edit) in 1-3 lines
5) Prefer deletions when two sections overlap.
6) Keep total output under 180 tokens.

Decision standard:
- "New" means a distinct failure mode or decision branch not currently represented.
- If a rule is implied by current wording, treat it as covered and do not propose it.

# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Proposing new review rejection rule**

I’m identifying a unique failure mode where reviews from former employees or ambassadors are rejected but not explicitly covered in the current documentation. After analyzing the batch and existing rules, I see the need to add a minimal patch that explicitly rejects software reviews from former employees lacking an active client relationship, referencing evidence record `65e787b9b029db20f0074e04`. This will fill a gap not addressed by the existing client-relationship plausibility guidelines.

**Finalizing new rule proposal**
codex
- Delta: Add explicit software rule rejecting former-employee/ambassador submissions lacking an active client relationship.
  - Why: Client-relationship plausibility only talks about tone, so it doesn’t cover reviews where the submitter self-identifies as a former/ambassador affiliate yet still fails the “client” requirement (record 65e787b9b029db20f0074e04 was rejected for that exact reason).
  - Evidence: 65e787b9b029db20f0074e04
  - Patch: + - Reject software reviews from former/employer ambassadors unless they prove an ongoing client relationship; treat them like non-client submissions needing stronger proof.
