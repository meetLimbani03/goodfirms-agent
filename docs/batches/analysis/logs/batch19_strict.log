Task: Analyze exactly one batch file against docs/review-verification-steps.md.

Output constraints (strict):
1) Return ONLY truly new rule deltas not already covered semantically by existing rules.
2) Do NOT restate, reword, or expand existing rules.
3) If no new delta exists, output exactly: NO_CHANGES.
4) Each proposed delta must include:
   - why existing rules do not already cover it
   - one concrete evidence record id from the batch
   - minimal patch text (add/remove/edit) in 1-3 lines
5) Prefer deletions when two sections overlap.
6) Keep total output under 180 tokens.

Decision standard:
- "New" means a distinct failure mode or decision branch not currently represented.
- If a rule is implied by current wording, treat it as covered and do not propose it.

# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Evaluating batch file for unique rule gaps**
thinking
**Identifying new duplicate submission rule**

I'm spotting a potential new rule to reject reviews whose text exactly matches previously published reviews, even outside the short time window or from different reviewers. The current doc only covers duplicates from the same reviewer within a short period. Record `65dc4df13bd170e8fb04df55` shows this gap. The delta patch would add a line rejecting these re-published submissions to prevent reposts.
codex
- Add a rule catching reviews that simply repost previously published content; the existing “duplicate” check only targets quick repeats by the same reviewer, so replays from older batches slip through. Evidence: record `65dc4df13bd170e8fb04df55` is flagged “Review has already been published before.” Patch: `+ - reject submissions whose text exactly matches a previously published review for the same software, even if it arrives outside the short duplicate window or from another reviewer.`
