# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

Ireava School ERP Unable to verify the reviewer

**Identifying new review verification patterns**
thinking
**Proposing removals and document refinements**

I'll suggest removing the inaccurate “Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks…” bullet since dataset entries show incomplete reviews still arrive, and recommend dropping or consolidating ambiguous or redundant rules like the duplicate-submission check note. I’m also outlining precise text edits to add new rules addressing placeholder websites, incomplete reviews via `step` checks, and detection of near-duplicate review content across different reviewers.
thinking
### New patterns not covered
- Placeholder and generic domains like `nowebsite.com` or Apple private relay emails appear in multiple entries (e.g., Ireava School ERP in dataset entries #2 and #3). These should be treated as insufficient evidence and trigger escalation to manual review unless supported by alternate verifiable links.
- Incomplete or in-progress reviews with metadata `step` less than 3 and zero or missing rating fields (as seen in Allway Sync #6 and Innago #7) still reach the agent despite upstream completeness expectations; a new gating rule should classify these as incomplete and halt further verification.
- Near-duplicate textual content across reviews for the same software (e.g., Fresa Gold entries #4 and #9) indicates probable template or spam submissions; detecting and flagging such near-identical summaries, strengths, and weaknesses even from distinct reviewers is necessary.

### Redundant rules to remove
- Remove the sentence under the document’s introduction section stating:  
  *“Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.”*  
  This is contradicted by dataset evidence (Allway Sync and Innago entries with incomplete steps and zero ratings), showing that this assumption is inaccurate.  
  _(Reference: dataset entries such as `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch2_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json` for Allway Sync #6 and Innago #7)_

### Exact proposed text edits
- `docs/review-verification-steps.md` (Introduction/Goal section):  
  Remove the sentence:  
  *“Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.”*

- Under section **1) Common Checks**, add a new bullet:  
  > - Immediately classify reviews as `Review incomplete` and escalate if metadata shows `step` less than 3, or if all rating fields are zero or missing title/summary; skip further verification steps for these.

- Under section **1.5 Duplicate-submission check**, add:  
  > - Flag reviews for the same software that share more than 80% overlap in summary, strength, and weakness text, even if submitted by different reviewer identities; treat as suspected templated/spam content requiring manual review.

- Under section **4.2 If no LinkedIn profile is available**, add:  
  > - Treat placeholder or generic company website domains (e.g., `nowebsite.com`) and anonymized email domains such as Apple private relay addresses as insufficient evidence; escalate these cases to manual review unless corroborated by alternative, verifiable contact information.

These edits reference dataset patterns from entries such as Ireava School ERP (#2, #3), Allway Sync (#6), Innago (#7), and Fresa Gold (#4, #9) demonstrating the need for these clarifications and new rules.
codex
### New patterns not covered
- Placeholder/anonymous identity signals are everywhere. The two Ireava School ERP records and several others only carry `client_company_website` = `https://nowebsite.com`, no profile link, and a private relay/personal email (e.g., `privaterelay.appleid.com`, `gmail.com`). The agent still marked them “Unable to verify the reviewer,” yet the current policy doesn’t treat these placeholders as missing evidence. We need a rule that treats non‑resolving/generic URLs and proxy email domains as “no verification possible” (manual review) unless we can anchor the reviewer to a real company page or LinkedIn profile.
- Incomplete reviews leak through. Entries for Allway Sync (two consecutive submissions with the same email, one entirely blank) and Innago (step 1, zero ratings, empty summary) prove the upstream completeness claim is false. We need a metadata guard that inspects `step`, the presence of summary/title/ratings, and outright zeros and short‑circuits the flow into a `Review incomplete` outcome before touching the rest of the policy.
- Template spam across reviewers: the two Fresa Gold entries reuse the same summary/strength/weakness wording under different names/emails but still get flagged for verification. The policy has no cross-review duplicate detector, so this batch shows we also need a near‑duplicate rule for identical prose to catch coordinated positive campaigns.

### Redundant rules to remove
- The intro sentence “Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy” is demonstrably false in this batch; multiple records (`Allway Sync`, `Innago`) have `step` < 3, zero ratings, and empty texts yet landed here with reason `Review incomplete`. Remove that sentence so the policy stops assuming completeness is handled elsewhere and instead owns the gatekeeping.

### Exact proposed text edits
- **docs/review-verification-steps.md → Goal paragraph (line 6)**  
  Remove: “Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.”  
  (Batch `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch2_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json` entries for Allway Sync/Innago prove this assertion wrong.)

- **docs/review-verification-steps.md → Section 1 “Common Checks”**  
  Add a new bullet after 1.1 or before 1.2:  
  `- Validate review metadata before any textual checks: if `step` < 3, `overall` (and the other ratings) are still 0, and/or title/summary/strength/weakness are blank, immediately classify the record as "Review incomplete" and skip the rest of the flow so we don’t verify partially submitted drafts.`

- **docs/review-verification-steps.md → Section 1.5 “Duplicate-submission check”**  
  Extend the bullet list with:  
  `- Extend the duplicate check beyond single reviewers: if multiple submissions for the same software reuse the same summary/strength/weakness phrasing (e.g., the two Fresa Gold reviews in this batch), treat them as templated/auto-generated content and send them to manual review even if reviewer metadata differs.`

- **docs/review-verification-steps.md → Section 4.2 “If no LinkedIn profile”**  
  Add:  
  `- Treat placeholder/generic URLs (e.g., `https://nowebsite.com`, other resolvers that return a parking page) or proxy/personal domains (such as `privaterelay.appleid.com`) as insufficient evidence. If the reviewer provides only these values, escalate the review unless alternate company/role confirmation is obtained via a genuine homepage or secondary profile.`
