# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Analyzing batch for new patterns**

I'm working through the batch to spot new patterns missing from current rules and find redundant ones. There’s a lot of interesting edge cases like entries with blank titles and summaries, suspiciously high ratings paired with generic promotional text, and missing proof flags. I want to identify precise new patterns to propose, figure out which existing rules might be unnecessary, and prepare detailed text edits referencing specific files with line numbers where possible. This will help tighten the verification policy by aligning it closely with the dataset nuances.

**Identifying policy gaps and redundancies**

I'm examining the dataset for new problematic patterns like hidden identities, empty reviews, and suspicious marketing-like content that current policies may overlook. I’m also looking for redundant or outdated rules—such as duplicate-submission checks—that the data suggests might no longer be necessary, referencing exact lines in the instructions to support these insights.

**Summarizing dataset and policy update plan**

I’m organizing new and redundant review patterns based on dataset lines and policy instructions. I’ll propose precise text edits referencing file paths and line numbers, identifying missing checks for hidden identities and blank fields, while suggesting removal of less relevant rules. The goal is a clear, evidence-backed update with explicit citations and actionable policy changes.

**New patterns not covered**
- The batch is dominated by `hidden_identity=1` submissions whose `title`, `summary`, `strength`, `weakness`, and all rating fields are empty or zero (see `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch6_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json:1`, `:2`, `:5`, `:6`, `:7`, `:9`). The policy’s readability checklist never calls out entirely vacant reviews as a separate failure mode, yet those records cannot be verified or improved and eat reviewer bandwidth.
- Step‑2 records still lack any identity proof yet contain verbose marketing copy that does not mention the named software but instead describes another product (see `docs/batches/...json:3`, `:8`, `:10`). Current rules only focus on generic content and rating/narrative alignment, so we still let in suspicious “self‑promo” bodies that mimic vendor marketing while providing no verifiable reviewer signal.

**Redundant rules to remove**
- Section 1.5’s “duplicate-submission” check (`docs/review-verification-steps.md:43`) is not exercised in this batch—the problems are missing content/identity rather than repeat submissions—so it can be removed to keep the checklist focused on the high‑volume blank/marketing cases we actually see.

**Exact proposed text edits**
- At `docs/review-verification-steps.md:19` add a third bullet under “Content readability and coherence”: `- Auto-flag reviews where title, summary, strength, weakness, and all rating fields are empty (especially when hidden_identity=1) because there is nothing to verify or improve and they are almost always spam/placeholders.`  
- In the Reviewer Verification section (e.g., after `docs/review-verification-steps.md:86`), add: `- Treat the platform’s hidden_identity flag as a strong authenticity risk: if it is set and no LinkedIn/company proof exists, escalate to manual review even for positive copy because we can’t cross-check the claimant.`  
- Remove the entire “1.5 Duplicate-submission check” block at `docs/review-verification-steps.md:43` so the checklist stays tightly aligned with the most common rejection drivers evidenced by this batch.
