# Review Verification Steps (Draft Policy)

## Goal
Define what the agent should verify for:
- Software reviews
- Service reviews
- Reviewer authenticity (LinkedIn vs Google login context)
- Web fact-check behavior

This is live-flow only (new reviews), not legacy backfill.
Only reviews that already pass upstream completeness pre-checks are sent to this agent policy.

Operational note (as of 2026-02-27):
- Production MySQL MCP (`Prod-goodfirms-mysql`) is currently not reachable.
- For service-review DB checks, use local `GoodFirms` imported from `data/gf.sql` (dump completed `2026-02-17 02:26:06`, 10 days old as of 2026-02-27).

## 1) Common Checks (Both Review Types)

### 1.1 Content readability and coherence
- Reviewer identity text should not be gibberish:

**Analyzing dataset verification patterns**

I’m exploring the dataset to uncover verification patterns, focusing on personal emails and hidden identity flags. I want to identify gaps in current rules, especially handling reviews with high ratings but lacking verifiable profile links or company websites, and propose stronger heuristics to improve authenticity checks. I’m also curious about the meaning of dataset steps and hidden_identity values to better interpret the data nuances.

**Summarizing verification policy gaps**

This is a detailed plan to identify new verification patterns and propose precise edits for the review-verification documentation. I’m analyzing why entries with company info still get rejected, emphasizing missing LinkedIn or hidden identity flags. Next, I’ll outline new patterns uncovered from dataset references, recommend removing placeholder duplicate-submission rules, and draft exact markdown sections with suggested text modifications. This approach aims to clarify ambiguous rules and enhance reviewer verification accuracy.
thinking
**Outlining detailed documentation changes**

I’m preparing exact text additions and removals for each required section, carefully quoting precise language to add under verification steps, web fact-checking, and redundant rules. I’m including dataset references to justify these edits and ensuring clarity on how hidden identity cases and corporate email without LinkedIn should be handled. This careful breakdown should make the proposed policy updates clear and actionable.
codex
### New patterns not covered
- `docs/batches/software_rejected_batch8_from_2023-07-01_humanized.json` entries 1‑8 and 10 all set `hidden_identity=1`, supply only personal Gmail addresses, and lack LinkedIn/company profile URLs, yet are flagged “Unable to verify the reviewer” despite coherent reviews; the policy never mentions how to treat hidden-identity submissions, so agents default to rejection without guidance on what alternative evidence would suffice.  
- Entry 9 shows a credible company email/website pair (`kristen@kellyclosets.com`, `https://zeststudio.co/`) but still fails verification purely because no LinkedIn link was provided; the policy only says to “use softer checks” without naming the concrete checkpoints (website, domain match, company directory) that would upgrade confidence from low/unknown to medium.

### Redundant rules to remove
- Section 1.5 (“Duplicate-submission check (this is hard, need it right now or skip for now?)”) is a placeholder with no implementation guidance and is never invoked in the batch analysis; drop it to avoid misleading downstream reviewers.

### Exact proposed text edits
- Delete the entire 1.5 subsection so the reader isn’t asked to act on a “skip for now” note that never produces reproducible behavior.  
- In section 4.2 (no LinkedIn profile), append:  
  > “If `hidden_identity` is truthy or the reviewer explicitly requested anonymity, treat the submission as privacy-sensitive—require at least one independent evidence point (e.g., company email/domain match, vendor directory entry, or validated support ticket) before advancing. Document the evidence and, if you cannot find anything beyond a personal email, mark the review as `needs_manual_review` rather than auto-rejecting or auto-approving.”  
- In section 5 (Web fact-check rules), add after the first bullet:  
  > “When a LinkedIn profile is missing but the reviewer provides a company website or corporate email, capture the domain match (email host vs. `client_company_website` host) and a supporting page (team/about/contact listing the reviewer or role). Treat a consistent domain + visible company page as ‘medium’ evidence and log it alongside the identity checks.”
