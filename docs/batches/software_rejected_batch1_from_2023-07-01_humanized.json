Setting up job postings, tracking candidates, and managing communications is seamless. The ability to tailor workflows to suit each sector has been particularly valuable, allowing us to maintain consistency while adapting to the nuances of different industries.\r\nThe automation features — such as resume parsing, email templates, and candidate status updates—have significantly reduced manual tasks, freeing up time for more strategic work. Integration with other Zoho apps and third-party tools like LinkedIn has also helped streamline our operations.\r\nCustomer support has been responsive and helpful whenever we’ve needed assistance,",
                    "strength": "What stood out most was Zoho Recruit’s flexibility and customisation. As a multi-sector recruitment agency, we needed a platform that could adapt to different workflows across multiple platforms. Zoho Recruit allowed us to tailor pipelines, forms, and communication templates to suit each division — all within a single system.\r\nThe automation tools were also a game-changer. Features like resume parsing, automated follow-ups, and candidate tracking helped us save time",
                    "weakness": "While Zoho Recruit offers a strong suite of features, there are a few areas that could be improved. The mobile app, for instance, lacks the full functionality of the desktop version, which can be limiting when working remotely or needing quick access to candidate data on the go.Additionally, some of the advanced customisation options — particularly around reporting and analytics — require a bit of a learning curve. It would be helpful if there were more intuitive guides or templates to support",

The applications that don&#39;t include key phrases relating to the educational qualifications or other skills get rejected automatically, saving the recruiters&#39; time and helping them achieve required efficiency.<\\/p><p><strong>Challenge #2 - Attracting Talent<\\/strong><\\/p><p>Attracting talent and encouraging them to apply for a job advertisement is the biggest challenge that companies face. As the internet is flooded with many job opportunities, the job requirement posted by you can seem to be not so attractive for the right talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p><p><strong>Solution #2 - Improving Online Presence and Reputation<\\/strong><\\/p><p>You need to enhance your company&#39;s online reputation and post the job requirements on the right channels to grab the candidates&#39; attention and motivate them to apply. You also need to provide as much information as you can about your company, work culture, and job requirements to the candidates, enabling them to make quick decisions.<\\/p><p><strong>Challenge #3 - Providing A Better Candidate Experience<\\/strong><\\/p><p>In this digital age, providing a great candidate experience is essential to the recruitment process. Many candidates complain about the late response from the HR team or unfair evaluation done with them. These instances can spoil the reputation of the company and drive away good candidates from applying.<\\/p><p><strong>Solution #3 - Communicating With The Candidates<\\/strong><\\/p><p>Many times, the recruitment process can take more time than expected. So, it is always better to communicate with the candidates and inform them about the same. Timely communication would improve the experience of the candidates with your company and form a better brand image.<\\/p><p><strong>Challenge #4 - Measuring Performance<\\/strong><\\/p><p>It is very important to measure the performance based on some real facts about how many applications were received and how many progressed to the next step of the recruitment process. Also, it is essential to know the sources from where you got the best candidates. Without reliable and authentic data, your future decisions may go wrong and impact adversely by recruiting the wrong candidates.<\\/p><p><strong>Solution #4 - Generating Reports<\\/strong><\\/p><p>You need to deploy the right recruitment tool that can generate reports and provide you with the right information, helping you make decisions that benefit your organization in terms of quality recruitment and the cost of hiring both.<\\/p>\",\"<p>The efficient recruitment process starts with planning the hiring strategies to eventually onboarding the candidates. Below-mentioned is the most common steps in the hiring process that companies usually follow regardless of their size and type of business.<\\/p><p><strong>Planning<\\/strong> - Preparing a recruitment plan includes determining the job vacancies and gathering the information about the qualifications of a candidate required to fill those job vacancies. It also includes deciding on which job portals or social media networks should be used to broadcast the job requirements so that you acquire relevant applications.<\\/p><p><strong>Sourcing<\\/strong> - After planning, the next step is to find and identify the right applicants for a particular job vacancy. It is about proactively searching for qualified candidates on relevant social media platforms and job portals and convincing suitable candidates to apply.<\\/p><p><strong>Acquisition<\\/strong> - After receiving the applications, it becomes important to screen and scrutinize them and identify suitable candidates that can be contacted for the interview and testing purposes. If the screening and the analyzing process are inefficient, the recruitment cost can increase, and so the acquisition is considered the most crucial step of the recruitment process.<\\/p><p><strong>Selection - <\\/strong>After the candidates get qualified after different rounds of interviews and tests, the recruiters need to check their references and background. If a wrong candidate gets hired, it can adversely affect the productivity and the culture of the entire organization, and so the companies need to be extremely careful while selecting the candidates.&nbsp;<\\/p><p><strong>Onboarding<\\/strong> - The recruitment process doesn&#39;t end at selecting and hiring a candidate. Onboarding is all about collecting the relevant documents from the newly hired employees, conducting induction training to provide them the complete information about the organization, and making them feel comfortable in the work culture. This helps the newly hired employees to adjust to their new jobs and quickly become productive and contributing members of your business organization.<\\/p><p><strong>Reporting<\\/strong> - To know the success or the failure of a recruitment process, it becomes important to generate reports that can tell you about the time and money utilized to hire employees for each job vacancy. This would help you determine the platforms that helped you acquire maximum applicants and how you can minimize your hiring costs.<\\/p>\",\"<p>Technological advancements have drastically transformed the recruitment process over the years. Before the internet came into usage, companies used to advertise their job requirements in the Newspaper classifieds section. The candidates used to line up in queues to appear for an interview. But, now, social media and job portals are used to inform the applicants about the job vacancies, applicants apply online, and interviews are scheduled in advance to avoid candidate waiting times and inconvenience.<\\/p><p>Precisely, technology has made it convenient for the recruiters to hire new people and for the candidates to acquire their dream job. Below-mentioned is some subtle differences that depict how the recruiting process has changed with time.<\\/p><p><strong>Expansive Reach<\\/strong><\\/p><p>Earlier approaching and reaching the right candidates was quite limited with the help of newspapers and trade magazines. But now there are many social media platforms and job portals through which recruiters get a chance to contact a plethora of candidates and get the opportunity to reach expansively.<\\/p><p><strong>Video Interviews<\\/strong><\\/p><p>Technology has made it possible for recruiters to interview candidates through video calls. Instead of asking the candidates to travel from places to attend the interviews, video calling has enabled recruiters to save their costs on the hiring process and provide convenience to the candidates. They can appear for the interview from their desired location.<\\/p><p><strong>Scheduled Interviews<\\/strong><\\/p><p>Earlier, recruiters had to make several phone calls to make candidates appear for the interview. And in case the interview used to get canceled for any reason, it would result in frustration for the recruiter and candidate both. With the help of appointment scheduling software or recruiting management software, it became possible for the recruiters and candidates to manage the interview schedules efficiently, even considering the different time zones.<\\/p><p><strong>Changed Priorities<\\/strong><\\/p><p>In earlier times, all the candidates used to expect the desired job profile and salary. But, now candidates prioritize the work culture, HR policies, leaves granted, entertainment &amp; leisure activities, holidays, etc. Similarly, the recruiters now consider background checks and the candidates&#39; ability to adopt a new atmosphere and become good team players, instead of just focusing on their educational qualifications and skills.<\\/p><p><strong>Candidate Experience<\\/strong><\\/p><p>Recruiters now allow the candidates to attend interviews at their own convenient time instead of taking a day off from their present job. The companies now emphasize candidate experience by reducing their waiting time and effective communication with them by incorporating technology into their recruitment process.<\\/p><p><strong>Employer Reputation<\\/strong><\\/p><p>The candidates now check the employer&#39;s online reputation before attending an interview. Many review sites provide information about the experiences the company has offered to its employees. Based on that, the candidates make decisions relating to attending interviews and accepting job offers. Due to this reason, the companies also keep on posting positive things about their work culture on social media platforms and ensure that their leaving employees post good reviews online.<\\/p><p><strong>Networking<\\/strong><\\/p><p>These days, it has become easier for companies to network with their prospective candidates on Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, etc., social media platforms, and stay connected with them. Whenever any job vacancy arises, the recruiters can easily contact the candidates that are already connected with them on social media and quicken the hiring process.<\\/p><p><strong>Data and Analytics<\\/strong><\\/p><p>With the help of technology, companies these days can extract real-time data informing them about the right and wrong decisions they have made in the past about recruiting new employees. Based on that data, the companies can make informed decisions for the future that can benefit them in saving time and money. Earlier, it was impossible to analyze the past and present recruitment information, as companies used to depend on spreadsheets and paperwork unable to generate reports with updated data.<\\/p>\",\"<p>Recruiting in the digital era refers to the advanced use of technology to find, attract, sort, select, and hire candidates suitable to your job vacancies.

The main advantage of Swing2App is that it can be used by people with little to no programming experience. It also has many features that make it intuitive to use, so you don&#39;t have to be an expert in computer science to know how to use the software. It has a built-in code editor and debugger, so you can fix bugs without having to go through complicated steps or learn new coding languages. The con is that it&#39;s not as powerful as some other tools out there, such as Unity or Unreal Engine. We&#39;ve found that we have to do much more work when using this tool than when using something else. For example, if we want to add an object to our game world or modify an object&#39;s properties (like its size), we usually have to use code snippets instead of just dragging and dropping as you would in other tools like Unity or Unreal Engine.</p>\r\n",

The best app builder can make that easy for you.<\\/p><p>The demand for application development is escalating on a large scale. From buying groceries to finding properties, applications are used&nbsp;everywhere; the primary reason is mobility and digitalization. You can use applications from anywhere and everywhere.<\\/p><p>Whether you are a startup, an established <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/directory\\/platform\\/app-development\\\">mobile app development company<\\/a>, or a mobile app developer, this buyer&#39;s guide to mobile app development software is for you. Here, we have covered the most significant aspects of app builder software so that you can make a smart purchase decision. To further clarify, here are the top reasons your business needs an application to succeed.<\\/p>\",\"<ul><li><strong>Increases Customer Engagement<\\/strong><br \\/>Applications can enable direct communication between the organization and its customers. Users who access your business application choose you over your competitors. To take advantage of that, you can consistently inform your customers about the new updates and offers you offer through push notifications. A business application makes your customers feel more connected to your business.<br \\/>&nbsp;<\\/li><li><strong>Ensures Customer Loyalty<\\/strong><br \\/>When customers search for a product or service on a search engine like Google, they may encounter many businesses. Still, when they download your business app and look at your catalog only, their chances of buying from you increase. At the same time, a loyalty program can be introduced to your customers through your business application, encouraging them to earn points on purchases, which can be redeemed later in the form of discounts at the time of future purchases.<br \\/>&nbsp;<\\/li><li><strong>Encourages Higher Conversions<\\/strong><br \\/>If the proper ASO (Application Search Optimization) strategies are applied, your business application will likely achieve higher online visibility. Moreover, these days, customers want to complete all their tasks quickly and at their fingertips, whether online shopping or paying bills. Thus, your business application is your direct marketing tool, which can encourage higher conversions.<br \\/>&nbsp;<\\/li><li><strong>Builds Brand Reputation<\\/strong><br \\/>A business application can build your brand reputation if it offers valuable features to your customers. The higher the number of customers involved with your business app, the higher the chances of making them inclined toward your business. Nowadays, customers consider brands with their business apps reputable.<\\/li><\\/ul><p>While a well-designed application can certainly boost revenue, what happens if your business app fails to captivate your audience? An application that doesn&#39;t deliver value to its users is ultimately ineffective. So, what are the key characteristics that define successful apps?<\\/p>\",\"<p>Whether you are in an online retail business, a service provider, social networking, or any other business, the qualities below in your application can add value to your target audience and grow your business.<\\/p><ul><li><strong>Appealing Design<\\/strong>: Your brand can be differentiated from your competitors by the look, design, and feel it provides to the users. An attractive design for your business app can attract your audience and ensure customer retention.<\\/li><li><strong>Platform-Friendly<\\/strong>: With so many devices available, if your business app does not work on multiple platforms, it might not yield the expected conversions. To make your business app successful, you must ensure it is platform-friendly and easily accessible to the audience.<\\/li><li><strong>User-Friendly<\\/strong>: People lack the time and patience to learn how to use complicated applications. To make your business app successful, you must ensure it is incredibly user-friendly.<\\/li><li><strong>Engaging<\\/strong>: Many people download the app on their devices and quickly uninstall it if they don&#39;t find it exciting and engaging enough. You must engage your customers with consistent notifications and updates to stay in business.<\\/li><li><strong>Affordable<\\/strong>: In the world of free apps, if you charge your customers a high fee to download your business app or quote higher prices for your products and services, it may be a turn-off for your business application. Keep your costs affordable to your customers to win their loyalty.<\\/li><li><strong>Ratings &amp; Reviews<\\/strong>: The ratings and reviews about your business app on the App Store significantly affect the downloads. Spreading positive word of mouth and creating good momentum about your business app ensures its success.<\\/li><\\/ul>\",\"<p>There are six basic steps to create an application for a business, as given below -<\\/p><ul><li><strong>Analyzing the Idea<\\/strong><br \\/>You have an excellent idea and want to turn it into an application. However, you must ask yourself: Will that idea benefit your target audience? Thorough market research can answer this question, and if the idea is feasible, it can be converted&nbsp;into an application.<br \\/>&nbsp;<\\/li><li><strong>Preparing Wireframes<\\/strong><br \\/>You know what your app will look like and what its features will be at this stage. You must also have decided on the scope of work and determined the tasks to be done in-house and to be outsourced. So, it is time to prepare a wireframe showing the application&#39;s features and how users would navigate it. These would also provide a clear picture of the time and budget to complete the application development project.<br \\/>&nbsp;<\\/li><li><strong>Designing<\\/strong><br \\/>Now that you have figured out your application&#39;s requirements, time, and budget, it is time to start designing the exact layout of all the application screens. It is always better to have a unique UI for your application that matches your brand identity. Your brand recognition and reputation depend on your application&#39;s UI; thus, it becomes vital to keep it aesthetically appealing.<br \\/>&nbsp;<\\/li><li><strong>Developing<\\/strong><br \\/>Once the design is complete, it is time to get into the technicalities of the application. At this stage, the application developers must use their coding skills and experience to achieve functionality and gain a competitive advantage for their business. Your business users expect a flawless experience while using your business application, and thus, you need to ensure that your application launch is bug-free and platform-friendly.<br \\/>&nbsp;<\\/li><li><strong>Testing<\\/strong><br \\/>How confident you are about your business application&#39;s functionality doesn&#39;t matter. It is always preferable to go through several rounds of testing before introducing it to the world. If, in any case, the application launches&nbsp;with several bugs, you may get many negative reviews, and that may harm your business. Moreover, using the concept of A\\/B testing in applications, the developers can determine the best version of the application, which can win maximum conversions. Thus, testing is one of the most critical phases of the application development process.<br \\/>&nbsp;<\\/li><li><strong>Launching<\\/strong><br \\/>Sparking widespread downloads becomes crucial after designing, creating, and refining your application. A successful app launch demands digital marketing strategies such as ASO (Application Search Optimization) and social media marketing. Without awareness of your launched application, the effort and resources invested in its development may be wasted. Therefore, launching the app and motivating users to embrace it is truly meaningful.<br \\/>&nbsp;<\\/li><li><strong>Post-Launching<\\/strong><br \\/>You cannot be sure about the application&#39;s success even after a grand launch and getting users to download it. The challenge of sustaining your business application starts here. It would be best to keep your audience consistently engaged with the app. Also, you must analyze and monitor usage, check user reviews, and respond to them. This will&nbsp;help you fix bugs and crashes in your application and improve the user experience.<\\/li><\\/ul>\",\"<p>The answer to this question depends on three different conditions.<\\/p><p><strong>Are you a business entrepreneur looking forward to launching your business app?<\\/strong><\\/p><p>If yes, you need to hire a team of application developers or outsource the entire app development project, which can be time-consuming and expensive.<\\/p><p><strong>Are you an app development company with too many app development projects?<\\/strong><\\/p><p>If yes, meeting deadlines may become difficult, resulting in dissatisfied clients, degrading company reputation, and financial loss.<\\/p><p><strong>Are you a newbie app developer or a freelancer?<\\/strong><\\/p><p>If yes, a lack of experience and a skilled team of developers may make developing a flawless and professional application difficult.<\\/p><p>Regardless of the conditions mentioned above, using app builder software would be a wise decision to make the entire app development process easy, effective, and profitable in terms of cost, effort, and time.<\\/p>\",\"<p>The app development software market is indeed saturated with numerous app builders, each proclaiming to be the ultimate solution.

Due to the size of the project involved we kept pushing it to lower priority, something always became more important!\r\n\r\nI began researching and found ASTPP would manage all of our requirements. We started off with the community edition. Even though we were used to operating a billing system we quickly assumed, wrongly, ASTPP would not be for us and nearly gave up.\r\n\r\nThe migration was not plain sailing and that is not the fault of the product. The sheer determination from the ASTPP team to make this a success has been staggering and they have worked with us to ensure a positive outcome. We have been live for a few months now and honestly have not looked back. Due to the additional features available we opted for the Enterprise edition along with a support package.\r\n\r\nWell done and thank you team ASTPP.",

                "faq_answer": "[\"<p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">Regardless of their size and area of operation, all business organizations can implement and use the customer success management tool. Because customer success management plays an indispensable role in retaining and augmenting the customer experience, most companies have a separate department and team to cater to this solution.&nbsp;<\\/p><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">Multiple departments and cross-functional teams within an organizational setup use free customer success software, such as product development teams, business executives, customer support, client servicing departments, etc.<\\/p><p><\\/p>\",\"<p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">Both customer success management and customer service management are integral parts of the business process, sharing similar goals, but the disparity lies in the implementation approach.&nbsp;<\\/p><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">Customer success tools are proactive and help clients accomplish their goals, whereas customer service software is reactive, meaning they help resolve a customer issue. Customer success is a continuously evolving process that aims to build robust relationships. Customer service ends when the customer problem gets resolved.<\\/p><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">CSM tools prioritize improving the retention rate, increasing the upselling and cross-selling, decreasing churn ratio, etc., while customer service focuses on enhancing communication and speed.&nbsp;<\\/p><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">The customer success manager aims to drive more value from the product to achieve the end desire. On the other hand, the customer service manager pays attention to improving the customer satisfaction level. Cross-departmental teams use customer success software whereas customer service software is used by one or two units.<\\/p>\",\"<p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">The customer support team can closely work with customer success management departments to boost the retention rate. First, businesses need to focus on building trust and a vital infrastructure by providing productivity tools to client success and support teams.&nbsp;<\\/p><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">Companies also have to consistently take customer feedback and work upon the loopholes to ensure top-class services. The CMS system even plays a significant role in educating the customer about the product. The software provides data, analyzing which you can understand the customer buying pattern. It helps customer success managers keep a close eye on changing metrics.<\\/p><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">Also, monitor the Net Promoter Score (NPS) to get insights about customer satisfaction levels. NPS helps to address customer concerns quickly and increase the retention ratio.<\\/p>\",\"<p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">One of the critical factors that allow customer success software to perform exceedingly well is its ability to sync with other widely used tools with ease. This means customer success managers can retain more clients and prevent churn. The additional software solutions that can integrate with CMS systems include <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/customer-service-software\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Customer Service Software<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/help-desk-software\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Help Desk Software,<\\/a> <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/customer-loyalty-software\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Customer Loyalty Software<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/review-management-software\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Review Management Software<\\/a>, and <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/reputation-management-software\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Reputation Management Software.&nbsp;<\\/a><\\/p><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">Also, the CSM system can align with <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/crm-software\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">CRM tools<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/change-management-software\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">change management software<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/workflow-management-software\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">workflow management software<\\/a> solutions, and more.<\\/p>\",\"<p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">Change management plays a crucial role in customer success management; hence, it is a critical feature of CMS software. Change management helps to improve the customer journey and focuses on three main areas of customer success management. These include motivation, where the best customer success software drives awareness amongst customers on why the change is beneficial.&nbsp;<\\/p><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">The second stage is empowering the customer to use the CMS system to make the changes streamlined and successful. You can take the support of learning materials and snippets to make the understanding simpler. The third step is the demonstration of the positive impact due to that change.<\\/p><p><\\/p>\",\"<p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">The customer success software market is expanding rapidly, with many customer success software vendors providing their tools to make the competition stiffer. In such a scenario, cost becomes a decisive factor in choosing a top-notch customer success software company. You get the option of free and open-source customer success software such as <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/software\\/bitrix24\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Bitrix24<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/software\\/agile-crm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Agile CRM,<\\/a> <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/software\\/engagebay\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">EngageBay<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/software\\/liveagent\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">LiveAgent,<\\/a> etc.&nbsp;<\\/p><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">If you are searching for a few more free customer success software with premium features, you can check the list of best customer success software generated by Goodfirms which includes&nbsp; <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/software\\/hubspot-service-hub\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">HubSpot Service Hub<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/software\\/totango\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Totango,<\\/a> and <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.goodfirms.co\\/software\\/froged\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Forged,<\\/a> etc.<\\/p>\"]",
